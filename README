Numeric Comparison logical operators
Comparison is used to check if statements evaluate to true or false. We can use the below shown operators to compare two statements:

Operation	Syntax	Explanation
Equality	              num1 -eq num2	->  is num1 equal to num2
Greater than equal to	  num1 -ge num2	->  is num1 greater than equal to num2
Greater than	          num1 -gt num2	->  is num1 greater than num2
Less than or equal to	    num1 -le num2	->  is num1 less than or equal to num2
Less than	              num1 -lt num2	->  is num1 less than num2
Not Equal to	          num1 -ne num2	->  is num1 not equal to num2

default syntax

if [ conditions ]
    then
         commands
fi

--------------------------
user input script with if.

read a
read b
read c

if [ $a == $b -a $b == $c -a $a == $c ]
then
echo EQUILATERAL

elif [ $a == $b -o $b == $c -o $a == $c ]
then 
echo ISOSCELES
else
echo SCALENE

fi

----------------------------

For loop

#!/bin/bash

for i in {1..5}
do
    echo $i
